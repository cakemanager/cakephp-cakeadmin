Shell Tasks
===========

The following shell tasks are provided by CakeAdmin:

### Init

To initialize CakeAdmin, the following shell command is available:

```
$ bin/cake cakeadmin init
```

This command will create a `/src/CakeAdmin.php` file.

### Admin

To create an administrator user for CakeAdmin, use the `admin` command:

```
$ bin/cake cakeadmin admin
```

This command will ask for your e-mail and name, and will set the default password `cakeadmin` (you can change this later on).
